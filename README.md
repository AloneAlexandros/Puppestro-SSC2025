This is my submission for the Swift Student Challenge 2025! I wanted to make something simple, silly and fun that had to do with music. Inspiried by the otamatone and other projects i saw that utlized the vision framework and the user's hand to play music, I landed on this: a musical sock puppet on your hand!
